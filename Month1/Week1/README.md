# Week 1: Networking Fundamentals

Welcome to Week 1 of Month 1 – **Foundational Knowledge**. This week, you'll dive into the basics of computer networking, focusing on key protocols and concepts such as DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, and the OSI model. Building a strong networking foundation is essential for any DevOps professional, as these concepts underpin communication and security in distributed systems.

---

## Topics to Cover

- **DNS (Domain Name System):**  
  Learn how domain names are translated into IP addresses and why DNS is critical for navigating the internet.

- **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure):**  
  Understand the protocols that facilitate web communication and how HTTPS adds a layer of security.

- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol):**  
  Get introduced to the core communication protocols used for data transmission across networks.

- **OSI Model:**  
  Familiarize yourself with the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system.

## Hands-On Activities

- **Concept Mapping:**  
  Create a diagram that illustrates how DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, and the OSI model interconnect. Use this visual map to explain how data travels from a web client to a server.

- **Reflection Exercise:**  
  Write a brief summary of each protocol or concept you studied this week. How does each component contribute to effective network communication?

- **Peer Learning Day (PLD) Preparation:**  
  Prepare a short presentation (or a written summary) discussing one networking concept you found most challenging or interesting. Share your insights and any questions during the PLD session using the hashtag `#DevOpsRoadmapChallenge`.
