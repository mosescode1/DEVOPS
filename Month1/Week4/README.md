# Week 4: Advanced Git and Scripting Fundamentals

Welcome to Week 4 of Month 1 – **Foundational Knowledge**. This week, you will continue building on your Git knowledge by exploring more advanced version control techniques. You’ll also enhance your scripting skills with Shell or Python, focusing on creating more complex scripts to automate tasks.

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Advanced Git Concepts
- **Branching and Merging Review:**  
  Reinforce the basics of branching and merging, and explore more advanced strategies for managing multiple branches in a collaborative environment.

- **Git Rebasing:**  
  Learn how to rebase your branches to maintain a clean project history. Understand when to use rebasing versus merging.

- **Conflict Resolution:**  
  Gain practical experience in handling merge conflicts and understanding how to resolve them effectively.

- **Tagging and Releases:**  
  Learn how to create tags in Git for marking releases and important milestones in your projects.

### 2. Intermediate Scripting
- **Shell Scripting (Advanced):**  
  Enhance your Shell scripts with loops, functions, and conditional logic to automate more complex tasks.

- **Python Scripting (Advanced):**  
  Delve deeper into Python with modules, file handling, and writing reusable functions for automation.

## Hands-On Activities

- **Advanced Git Exercises:**
    - Rebase a feature branch onto the main branch and resolve any conflicts that arise.
    - Create tags to mark specific releases or important milestones in your project.
    - Experiment with different branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow, feature branching).

- **Scripting Challenge:**
    - **Shell Scripting Task:** Write a script that automates the backup of files from one directory to another, with error handling and logging.
    - **Python Scripting Task:** Create a Python script that reads a text file, processes the content (e.g., counts word frequency), and outputs the results to a new file.

- **Peer Learning Day (PLD) Preparation:**
    - Prepare a brief demonstration of a complex Git workflow you practiced this week or a script you developed.
    - Share the challenges you encountered with rebasing or conflict resolution.
    - Use the hashtag `#DevOpsRoadmapChallenge` to showcase your work and learn from your peers.
