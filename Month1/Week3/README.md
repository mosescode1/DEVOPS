# Week 3: Introduction to Git and Basic Scripting

Welcome to Week 3 of Month 1 – **Foundational Knowledge**. In this week, you'll begin working with Git, the essential version control system, and get a taste of basic scripting using either Shell or Python. This week is designed to help you understand how to manage your code effectively through version control and start automating simple tasks with scripts.

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Git & Version Control
- **Version Control Fundamentals:**  
  Understand why version control is important for collaboration and project management.
- **Git Basics:**  
  Learn how to initialize a repository, commit changes, and track your project history.
- **Branching and Merging:**  
  Explore how branching can help manage different features or versions and how merging integrates those changes back into the main codebase.

### 2. Basic Scripting
- **Introduction to Shell/Python Scripting:**  
  Begin with writing simple scripts to automate routine tasks.
- **Scripting Fundamentals:**  
  Learn key concepts such as variables, control structures, and simple file manipulation.

## Hands-On Activities

- **Git Repository Setup:**
    - Initialize a new Git repository for a small project.
    - Practice creating commits, branching, and merging.
    - Experiment by intentionally creating a branch for a feature and merging it back into the main branch.

- **Simple Scripting Exercise:**
    - Write a basic script using Shell or Python that performs a simple task (e.g., a script that backs up a file, renames files in a directory, or prints system information).
    - Document your script with comments to explain what each part does.

- **Peer Learning Day (PLD) Preparation:**
    - Prepare a short demo or presentation summarizing your experience with Git commands and your first script.
    - Discuss any challenges you encountered, and share tips on managing code versions or automating tasks.
    - Use the hashtag `#DevOpsRoadmapChallenge` when sharing your progress.
