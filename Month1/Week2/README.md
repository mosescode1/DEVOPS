## Hands-On Activities

- **Command Practice Session:**  
  Open a terminal and practice the basic commands you’ve learned. Create, move, copy, and delete files and directories. Experiment with viewing file contents using commands like `cat`, `less`, or `tail`.

- **File System Exploration:**  
  Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd` to explore the Linux file system. Create a simple diagram of the Linux directory structure based on what you learn from the tutorials.

- **User Management Exercise:**  
  If you have access to a Linux system (or a virtual machine), try creating a new user account, then listing all users. Explore how to modify user permissions and understand why these operations are important in a multi-user environment.

- **Peer Learning Day (PLD) Preparation:**  
  Prepare a brief summary or a demo showcasing a few key Linux commands and what they do. Be ready to share your experiences or any challenges you encountered during your practice, and ask questions if needed.
